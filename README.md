JavaScript Array Methods are actions that csn be performed on objects.There are different Array methods such as:
   Array toString() - This method converts an array to a string, and separateds the value with a comma.
   Array length - it returns the length size of an array.
   Array pop(): It is used to remove the last element of an array, e.g const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange". "Apple", "Mango"];
                                                                        fruits.pop();
                                                          The Result: Banana, Orange, Apple
Array push() - It adds a new element to an array at the end, e.g const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange". "Apple", "Mango"];
                                                                    fruits.push("kiwi");
                                                                    The Result: Banana, Orange, Apple, Mango, Kiwi
Array shift()- This method removes the first element and shifts the other element to a lower index. It shifts the element to the left of the array, 
                                                                                 The Resulst: Cecilie, Lone, Emil, Tobias, Linus
                                                                                  friuts.shift();
                                                              The Result: Orange, Apple, Mango.
  Array unshift() - This method adds a new element to an array at the beginning  e.g const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
                                                                                          friuts.unshift("Lemon");
                                                                                            The Result: Lemon, Banana, Orange, Apple, Mango
  Array delete() - This method deletes array element and leaves undefined holes in the array when used.
  Concatenating Arrays - This method creates a new array by joining existing arrays e.g const myGirls = ["Cecilie", "Lone"];
                                                                                        const myBoys = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"];
                                                                                        const myChildren = myGirls.concat(myBoys);
                                                                            The Resulst: Cecilie, Lone, Emil, Tobias, Linus
Flattening An Array: This is used to create a new array with sub-array elements joined to a specified depth.E.g const myArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
                                                                                                                  const newArr = myArray.flat();
                                                                                                  The Resulst: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  splice() - It adds new items to an array to an array:   e.g const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange". "Apple", "Mango"];
                                                               fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "kiwi");
                                                               The Result: Banana, Orange, Lemon, Kiwi Apple, Mango

Array slice() - Removes a piece of an array into a new array. It can take two arguments like slice(1, 3), it selects element from the start arguments, and up to but not including the end arguments
 e.g const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange". "Apple", "Mango"];
      const citrus = fruits.slice(1);



      Summary On FUNCTIONS
      A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is executed when something invokes it or when it is called. It is defined with the function keyword followed by a name and parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar sign, while the parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas.
      The code to be executed is placed inside the curly brackets: {}. When a return statement is reached, the function will stop executing, With function the code is re-useable, same code with differrent arguments can be used to produce different results.
      The () operator invokes or calls the function. Without using (), it returns the function and not the function result.
      Local variables are variables declared within a javascript function, and can only be accessed from within the function.





      Summary on Control Flow Statement

      Control flow statement allow you to control the order in which statements are executed in your program, based on certain conditions or criteria.

      If/Else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.


      Switch statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable or expression.

      The loops statement has :
      For loops, While loops (Do while)
